The Odin Project - Sign-Up Form Project

Website: https://rithvikbona.github.io/odin-form/

This project is meant to showcase basic html form skills in order to create a mock sign-up page. I include rudimentary password restraints such as a minimum length, and use flexbox to create the layout of the page. No actions are performed when the form is submitted.
